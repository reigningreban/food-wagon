# FoodWagon Landing Page

This project is an implementation of the design file from [This Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/996012879169900959). It is built as a React.js Single Page Application (SPA) using the [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) framework for navigation. The application is styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and incorporates some UI components from the [ShadCN](https://shadcn.dev/) library.

A live version of this repository can be found [here](https://francis-food-wagon.netlify.app/) (Not optimized for mobile)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build files will be located in the `build/client` directory.

## Current Limitations

- The SPA is not yet mobile responsive.

## Future Improvements

- Implement mobile responsiveness to enhance usability on smaller devices.
- Add unit and integration tests to improve code reliability.
